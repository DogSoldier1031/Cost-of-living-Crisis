"The findings show the price of a median single-family house surged to $350,000 in the second quarter, a 10% jump from the previous quarter, one of the biggest increases in the past decade. 

That price is also 2% above last year's peak, according to the report, before the spike in mortgage rates cooled demand among would-be homebuyers.  

The portion of average wages required to own a home, meanwhile, skyrocketed to 33% in the period from April to June. That marks the highest debt-to-income ratio since 2007, meaning the market is the least affordable for Americans in nearly two decades.

The lack of affordability is widespread across the country, with prices rising in about 98% of counties when compared to historical averages"
